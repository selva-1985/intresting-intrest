Each month, the balance of your savings account is updated based on its interest rate. The interest rate your bank gives you depends on the amount of money in your account (its balance):

1.213% for a balance less than 50 dollars (balance gets more negative, for not maintaining minimum balance).
0.8% for a balance greater than or equal to 50 dollars, and less than 2500 dollars.
2.021% for a balance greater than or equal to 2500 dollars, and less than 5000 dollars.
3.475% for a balance greater than or equal to 5000 dollars.
